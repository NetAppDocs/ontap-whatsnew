NetApp ONTAP is the industry-leading flagship data-management software from NetApp that enables you to seamlessly manage and protect your data wherever it lives, whether on-premises, at the edge, or in the cloud.

NetApp ONTAP offers support for the following features, all on the same platform:

* NAS protocols (NFS and SMB)
* SAN protocols (iSCSI, FCP, and NVMe)
* S3 data access
* Data protection (NetApp Snapshot copy, NetApp SnapMirror, and SnapVault technologies)
* Storage efficiencies (deduplication, compaction, and compression)
* High Availability (HA) failovers (including fast failovers for Tier-1 SAN with the All-SAN Array)
* Support for all-flash, spinning drive, and hybrid disk configurations
* Security features (multifactor authentication, NetApp Volume Encryption, and Secure Purge)

This is not a comprehensive list; if we included every feature offered by ONTAP, this document would be hundreds of pages long.
